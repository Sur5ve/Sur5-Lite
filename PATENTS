# Patent Grant and Defensive Termination

## Additional Grant of Patent Rights (Version 1)

"Software" means the Sur5 Lite software distributed by Sur5ve LLC under the MIT License.

Sur5ve LLC hereby grants to each recipient of the Software ("you") a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated
in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
import, and otherwise transfer the Software, where such license applies only to
those patent claims, both currently owned or controlled by Sur5ve LLC and acquired
in the future, licensable by Sur5ve LLC that are necessarily infringed by the
Software as distributed by Sur5ve LLC.

## Defensive Termination

If you (or any of your subsidiaries, corporate affiliates, or agents) initiate
directly or indirectly, or take a direct financial interest in, any Patent
Assertion against Sur5ve LLC or any licensee of this Software:

1. **Immediate Termination:** Any patent rights granted to you under this document
   shall automatically terminate as of the date such Patent Assertion is first filed.

2. **Definition of Patent Assertion:** "Patent Assertion" means any lawsuit,
   claim, action, or proceeding alleging direct, indirect, or contributory
   infringement or inducement to infringe any patent, including cross-claims
   and counterclaims.

3. **Scope:** This termination applies to all versions of the Software, including
   past, present, and future releases.

## No Other Rights

This patent grant does not extend to:
- Trademarks (see TRADEMARK.md)
- Third-party components (see licenses/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
- Derivative works not distributed by Sur5ve LLC

## No Implied Licenses

Except for the explicit patent license granted above, no other patent rights are
granted by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

## Disclaimer

THIS PATENT GRANT IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL SUR5VE LLC BE
LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF THE
SOFTWARE.

## Why This File Exists

This PATENTS file provides explicit patent peace to users and contributors of
Sur5 Lite. Many open source licenses (like MIT) do not include explicit patent
grants, which can create uncertainty for commercial users.

Key benefits of this grant:
1. **Clarity:** Explicit permission to use any Sur5ve LLC patents in the Software
2. **Protection:** Defensive termination discourages patent trolling
3. **Peace of Mind:** Commercial users can adopt Sur5 Lite with confidence

This approach is modeled after similar patent grants used by major open source
projects (e.g., React, Go, Apache projects).
